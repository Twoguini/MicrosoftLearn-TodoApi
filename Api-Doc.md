# Api Documentation 

A simple API developed to explore and learn ASP.NET Core and C#. This project extends the foundational concepts from Microsoft's learning resources by incorporating additional functionalities such as automated tests, data validations, and platform-specific scripts (Windows and Gnome-Based Linux Distros) for running the application and tests.

This Api Create, Read and Delete To-do Tasks and uses a `Record` as a **DB Mockup**. 

As intendend by Microsoft when creating this "Step by Step" tutorial, i used this Api to learn and develop my habilities on C# and ASP.NET. This Api isn't only a result of that tutorial, i went far and created some features by myself.
